# Restaurant_Chatbot
Restaurant_Chatbot is a simple automatic communicating system for an imaginary bakery shop. Also, the system takes your order, suggest you something if the thing you are looking for isn’t available, or gives you random suggestion about what you would like to try. This automated communication system is developed using Python. The project file contains a python script (main.py). Talking about this chatbot, it allows the user to make them order the various types of food items of their own choices or the orders from the system’s random choices. At last, this chatbot shows you all your ordered items and finishes. Also, this is a simple cmd-based project which is easy to understand and use
